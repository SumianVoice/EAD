# EAD Design System
*Emotion, Activity, Design*

This system is intended to reduce the amount of bad or pointless features in a game's design and help focus you as a designer on the purpose of your game. It will not help write a dopamine tredmill, but it will help you make a game that is intrinsically enjoyable.

## How the design system works
Emotions are responses to playing your game; excitement, anticipation, mastery, intrigue etc. These are the things that make the game fun or enjoyable. Importantly, they are the thing you're about to justify with gameplay.

Activities or Actions are things the player does; gameplay. These are things like "Fighting enemies" or "Planning a city". These are the things you do in the game. Most games only need two of these, many have 5, many AAA games have 30 but only needed 5. Again, we're about to justify these, so choose wisely.

Designs. These are statements about your game or the Activity that make it so that: 1) players actually care enough to do the Activity, 2) players actually want to do the Activity, and 3) players doing the Activity will actually feel that Emotion or response you decided previously.

You can see how this disadvantages pointless features and focuses your Design process; if you wanted to add limited inventory space as a Design`, and so now you have the Activity of managing your inventory, which Emotion does that encourage? Does it actually encourage that Emotion at all? This is the purpose of the design paradigm; make it really hard to design pointless things, and really easy to design intrinsically fun things.

## Tips on game design
If you start with a gimmick like "it has voxels" or "Game X but with Y", that's not game design, it's marketing. If you want to *design* a game, start with near nothing. Maybe you have an aesthetic, like "medieval fantasy" or "steampunk" or "space scifi", and a basic premise like "save the world" or "get revenge" or "discover the plot". From there, *do not add any more 'features' yet*. Instead, use EAD as if it is itself a game or a puzzle; try to make something using the structure of EAD that seems enjoyable to play. Don't add features because they make you feel inspired or nostalgic, add Emotions that fit your premise, Activities that explicitly cause those Emotions, and Designs that augment and improve that experience. If you start with a gimmick, you will end with a gimmick.

It can take some getting used to before the merits of this system are truly felt, since it's a very foreign concept initially. Game design is hard. It's especially hard when you *want* a certain type of game, and that type of game has never worked before or has only been achieved through dopamine tredmill-like design.

## How the software works
It should be pretty self explanatory; open the `index.html` in a browser, use the `+` buttons to add a node to that block, and `-` button to remove. You can save and load using the buttons. Make sure you save and copy out the code regularly, as **this program does not autosave or store anything in the browser**. In other words, if you do a bunch of design work and then press the `save` button and close the browser without copying and pasting it somewhere else, it is *lost forever*.

## Who invented it?
Sumi (sumianvoice) c. 2020. Initially it was called EAMD with M being mechanics. I removed the mechanic part since it was redundant; mechanics are just necessary code systems that you have to make in order to *implement* the game, not *design* it.

Previously for many years I used another system I created called CAPR; Challenge, Accessibility, Progress and Replayability. This system was geared towards dopamine tredmills. It was quite effective too, but for a type of game I don't care for anymore.

Good luck on your games!
